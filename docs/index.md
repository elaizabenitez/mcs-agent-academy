# Copilot Studio Agent Academy

**Welcome to Copilot Studio Agent Academy.**  

Your mission—should you choose to accept it—is to master the art of building agents using **Microsoft Copilot Studio**.

This hands-on training is your entry point into the **world of agents**: from grounded prompts to Adaptive Cards and agent flows, you'll learn how to build, scale, and deploy intelligent agents using real-world tools and use cases.

## 🏅 Rank Progression

The **Copilot Studio Agent Academy** is a multi-phase training program designed to build your skills across three agent ranks. Each level includes a badge and increasing responsibilities:

| Rank             | Level | Status                                                   | Visual                                                                            |
|------------------|:-----:|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Each level builds on the last. Finish your Recruit mission, and stay tuned to level up your agent credentials.

## ⚠️ Before You Begin

### Progressive Difficulty

This training is designed to **increase in difficulty** as you progress. Each rank and each module within a rank builds on the last, introducing more advanced concepts and requiring deeper platform knowledge. **It is completely normal if you are unable to complete every module**. Go as far as your skills and environment allow, and come back when you're ready to tackle the next challenge.

### Environment & Licensing

**We do not provide environments for this training.** You are responsible for securing your own Microsoft 365, Power Platform and Copilot Studio environment.

We provide instructions for obtaining **free trials** (e.g., Microsoft 365 business tenant, Copilot Studio trial, Power Apps developer plan), but be aware:

- Trials have **time limits** and will eventually expire.
- After the trial period, a **paid license** is required to continue.

You are also welcome to use an **existing work or organizational account**, but your ability to complete certain modules depends on the features and permissions available in your environment.

For example:

- You need the ability to **upload and import solutions** into your environment.
- You need access to **Microsoft Dataverse**.
- For the MCP module, you need to be able to **join the Frontier program**.
- Some modules require **administrative permissions** to create agents and configure settings.

If a module requires a capability you don't have access to, you can **skip it** and move on, but keep in mind that many modules **build on previous ones**. Skipping a module may mean you're missing a dependency (like a solution, agent, or data) that later modules expect to be in place. You may be able to work around this, but in some cases it could block your progress on subsequent modules.
